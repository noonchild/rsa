  RockStarAlley.com is the brainchild of Krister Axel. This is the first game of it's kind to be written for <b>Ruby on Rails</b>.
  Games of this sort are commonly referred to as PBBG, which stands for <b>P</b>ersistent <b>B</b>rowser-<b>B</b>ased <b>G</b>ame. There is a fair amount of AJAX going on here as well, which is part of what makes RockStarAlley such a revolutionary experience. Just sign up for a free account, and have at it. Thanks for playing RockStarAlley.<br><br>
  See you at a gig!
