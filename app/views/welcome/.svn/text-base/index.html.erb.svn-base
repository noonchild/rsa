We are just getting started.
<br><br><br>
In September I see boots before<br>
the first rain, vast migrant flocks<br>
flying before the last late sunset<br>
threatens: a strange, nervous pox<br>
which might never find a certain cure<br>
where the stricken fly in nervous flocks<br>
<br>
In September I can't focus, I<br>
am estranged, staring out<br>
at the passional sky so proud<br>
to be falling so many<br>
dreams happily dying and by<br>
each day these old colors flushing out.<br>
<br>
Is that not the way, in September<br>
of all things answering to<br>
love? To be sudden, elegant<br>
and trampled like the fallen truth<br>
in September when time is so fast<br>
and every moment is the last<br>
moment of summer
